RTFlowLayout
============

Like UICollectionViewFlowLayout, but with additional supplementary views.

Heavily based on https://github.com/steipete/PSTCollectionView by Peter Steinberger, but using regular UICollectionViewLayout API.
Check the Example project to see how it's used.

Use it as you see fit and don't blame me for anything. This was a learning experience for me, I hope it will be for you too.
